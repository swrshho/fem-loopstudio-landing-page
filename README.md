# fem-loopstudio-landing-page

Hello World!

this is my (almost) solution to the frontend mentor's loop studio landing page.

this project has a complex layout, and a little bit of JS for the hamburger button.

although this project gave me a hard time, but i'm glad that i did it because i learned so much about grid and flex layouts.
this project taught me a lesson of organizing my project and writing it in a way that is maintainable.
i did't do either of those, so now it is a mess!
it's not 100% responsive, and it needs some seirouse reorganization.
but i made as responsive as i could and it works perfect in 375px wide mobile screens and 1440px wide screens and pretty much all screen sizes exept for some cases.
i need to come back to this project and organize it and fix the little bugs in responsiveness, but at this point i need to take brake from it and learn how to love it again :)
